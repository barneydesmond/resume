A Linux sysadmin turned technical writer, I'm a hacker at heart who loves
teaching people new things. I pull things apart, I learn about them,
I understand then. Then I write about them.

HOW I WORK

 - Modus operandi: Marketing and sales, hardcore technical analysis or end-user
          guides, I understand the target audience and write accordingly.
 - Medium: Everything is hypertext these days (but I'll happily do print) so I
          write copy, create diagrams and screenshots, and do photos and A/V if
          it's most appropriate for the subject.
 - Software: Browser and vim for wikis and markup, Inkscape/Gimp/Photoshop as needed
          for imagery, Audition and Premiere for audio and video. I learn
          whatever it takes to get the job done.
 - It's all about text: Markdown is my go-to for almost anything that isn't in a
          wiki, and my favourite wiki is Moin, though I'm comfortable with
          with anything else (Confluence included, of course!). LaTeX for
          beautiful documents. Will cut raw HTML and CSS in a pinch.
 - Technical: As a former webhosting sysadmin, my knowledge covers a very wide
          gamut including: Linux and Windows, programming (both scripting and
          compiled languages), databases, networking, security and automation.
 - Time management: I'm a big fan of kanban-style management for its visibility
          and simple nature that lets me coordinate with my team and
          Get Things Done quickly.
 - People: I can get along with just about anybody. Many years of customer-facing
          experience has made me a good listener, measured in response,
          professional and eloquent. I'm always ready to share my knowledge,
          and can present confidently as needed.
