<DRAFT>


Hi/G'day,

A former coworker of mine at Anchor and current sysadmin at Atlassian, Paul
DeAudney, mentioned that a vacancy recently opened up for a Technical Writer
in Sydney.

I am your new Technical Writer.

Anchor, much like Atlassian, firmly believes in smart people building and
doing amazing things. I'm proud to have been part of a team that's been doing
just that for the past six years, but now I feel I'm ready for a change.

I'm ready for new challenges and to do new things, and Atlassian is where I
want to be.

<Is this shit getting too waffly?>


<BEGIN: ALTERNATIVE TO THE LAST TWO PARAGRAPHS>

I've been part of the amazing team at Anchor for the past six years, and now
I feel it's time for a change. I greatly admire Atlassian as a company, for
it's vision and culture, and that's where I want to be.

<END:   ALTERNATIVE TO THE LAST TWO PARAGRAPHS>


Outline the fact that I've only been doing tech writing for 1.5 years, not 3,
but my hardcore technical experience should more than cover for that, along
with my strong communication skills, and my ability to learn really fast.

Carp on some more about how I'll be good at the job, and thank them for their
consideration, and sign off.
