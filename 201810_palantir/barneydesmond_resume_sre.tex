\setstretch{1.2}
I have over a decade of experience designing and running Linux systems. I'm
used to solving difficult problems, and I take a rigorous approach to ensure
the job is done properly. My background is in managing the full stack for
web-facing applications, but my interests are much broader and I quickly pick
up new skills as needed.

% VRA API scripting with Python and Makefiles
\item Developed automation and scripting to build new systems rapidly.
% Preflight checks across various RHEL versions, picky partitioning with SAP systems, use of tingle for hands-off patching
\item Systematically eliminated points of failure that prevented timely patching of systems.
% Onboarding+departure of staff, managing accounts in LDAP for services, shift to LDIF templating for this
\item Wrote docs for processes to ensure repeatability and automation, and enable faster training of new staff.
% MW team's SSO stuff, pushed to Satellite, deployed with Puppet
\item Automated packaging and deployment of internally developed software via RedHat Satellite.
% Proof-of-concept with PG 9.6, deployed PG10, full auto config of replication and backups, start deploying Barman
\item

% DCR, migration to cloud, use of VRA for VM deployment, new network segment organisation w/ firewalls
% XXX: not sure I have enough room for this one
%\item Worked across teams to help drive changes to virtualisation, storage, and networking.

\item Wrote \emph{UMAD}, a knowledge search engine spanning disparate sources of information, including our wiki, support ticketing system, domain registrations, and CRM.
\item \emph{Vaultaire} and associated microservices, a time-series database for large-scale storage of monitoring metrics, built on top of the Ceph datastore.
\item Internal software was deployed using \emph{Docker} containers, onto our in-house \emph{Openstack} cluster.
\item \emph{Jenkins} and \emph{Travis} CI for packaging and deployment to private repos, in addition to comprehensive testing.
