Good day,

* Former coworker
* Been doing R&D
* Interested in getting back to ops
* Perfect position and systems that I know
* Eager to drive change

A former coworker of mine at Anchor and now sysadmin at Atlassian, Paul
De Audney, mentioned that a vacancy recently opened up for a Technical
Writer in Sydney.

I am your new Technical Writer.

I have been part of an amazing team at Anchor for the past six years, and
now I feel it's time for a change. I greatly admire Atlassian as a company,
for its vision and culture, and that is where I want to be.

Technical writing is a relatively recent endeavour for me, a large part of
my work to date has been as a linux sysadmin. My hands-on experience with
systems and software development practices was a great asset when I moved
into technical writing, and I believe this makes me ideally suited for the
role at Atlassian. I know the products that I'll be dealing with at
Atlassian, and I'm going to hit the ground running.

In short: I love writing documentation, and I'm excited about the prospect
of working for Atlassian. I hope to hear from you shortly.


Sincerely,

Barney Desmond
